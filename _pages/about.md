Hi friends， this is Yiqing Wang. I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), and will receive a Bachelor's Degree in [Biomedical Engineering](http://en.bme.sjtu.edu.cn/) in June 2023. I'm going to be a Ph.D. candidate of [Department of Biomedical Engineering](https://bme.duke.edu/) at [Duke University](https://duke.edu/) since fall 2023. I will join in [Vision and Image Processing Lab](https://people.duke.edu/~sf59/) directed by Professor [Sina Farsiu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=mzcr92sAAAAJ). My research interest is deep-learning-based biomedical data processing, such as organ segmentation, disease diagnosis, image reconstruction, and image registration.
