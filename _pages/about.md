My name is Yiqing Wang. I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), and will receive a Bachelor's Degree in [Biomedical Engineering](http://en.bme.sjtu.edu.cn/) in June 2023. My research interest is deep-learning-based biomedical data processing, such as organ segmentation, disease diagnosis, domain adaptation, image reconstruction, and image registration. Now I'm applying for a Ph.D. program in Medical Image Analysis & Computer Vision.
