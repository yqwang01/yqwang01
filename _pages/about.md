I'm fourth-year undergraduate student from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and will receive a Bachelor's Degree in Biomedical Engineering in June 2023. My research interest is deep-learning-based biomedical data processing, such as organ segmentation and disease diagnosis. Now I'm applying for a Ph.D. program in Medical Image Analysis & Computer Vision.

You can see my resume [here]().
