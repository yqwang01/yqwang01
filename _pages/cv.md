## Scholar experience

* **Dec. 2022 – Jun. 2023**: IMIT @ SJTU directed by Lichi Zhang \
  A 2D/3D Registration Method for Full-length Images of Lower Limbs
  * Constructed the first 2D-3D registration network for X-rays and CT images of full-length lower limbs
  * Adopted the shifted-window self-attention and the cross-attention mechanism for efficient feature extraction
  * Proposed SigmoidDiceLoss, which makes the registration of discrete labels continuous and differentiable

  Multi-view MAE for 3D medical image representation learning
  * Presented the first multi-view pipeline for self-supervised medical image analysis
  * Achieved a comparable performance to the current state-of-the-art method with less training cost
  * Published in *MICCAI 2023*

* **Feb. 2022 – Jan. 2023**: Advanced MRI Lab @ SJTU directed by Hongjiang Wei \
  Brain Region Segmentation and Age Estimation Using QSM
  *  Created a novel network to segment several key brain areas on QSM images to improve brain age prediction
  *  Improved brain age estimation compared to previous studies based on T1w MRI
  *  Published in *ISMRM 2023* and *IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (JBHI)*

* **Aug. 2021 – Feb. 2022**: CITI @ SJTU directed by Guoyan Zheng \
